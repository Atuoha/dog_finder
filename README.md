# Testing
Testing this Flutter App on iOS and Android
This guide will walk you through the process of testing a Flutter app on both iOS and Android platforms. You can use popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or Xcode for this purpose. Additionally, we'll cover testing on both emulators and physical devices.

Prerequisites
Flutter and Dart should be installed on your system.
You've set up your development environment for iOS and Android.
You've cloned the Flutter project from GitHub.
Cloning a GitHub Repository
If you haven't already, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Atuoha/dog_finder
cd dog_finder

Setting Up Your Project
Open Your Project: Launch Visual Studio Code or Android Studio and open your Flutter project.

Running pub get: Before testing, make sure to run pub get to fetch the project dependencies. You can do this by opening the terminal inside your project directory and running:

flutter pub get

Select Your Target Device: At the bottom right corner of VSCode or in Android Studio, click on "No Devices" and select either an emulator or a physical device.

Run Your App: Click the "Run" button (or press F5 in VSCode or Shift + F10 in Android Studio) to launch your app on the selected device.

Using Xcode (for iOS)
Open Your Project: Open your Flutter project in Xcode by navigating to ios/Runner.xcworkspace.

Select Your Target Device: In the Xcode project, choose a connected iOS device or a simulator.

Run Your App: Click the "Play" button (or press Cmd + R) to launch your app on the selected iOS device or simulator.

Testing on Emulator vs. Physical Device
Emulator:
Emulators are software-based and allow you to simulate a real device.
Ideal for initial testing, especially when you don't have access to physical devices.
Can be slower than physical devices, and some hardware-specific features may not work accurately.

Physical Device:
Testing on a real device provides the most accurate results.
Ideal for performance testing, real-world user experience, and testing device-specific features.
Requires access to the physical device and sometimes additional setup.
